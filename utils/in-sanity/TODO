The main purpose of this project is to provide an external sanity check to
naev.

MAJOR:

 *) (idea) Could use readers to deal with validation. So, readers could
    detect flaws and doctor will be more useless but it is more flexible.

    BORING STUFF:

        *) first off you should make sure all the assets in asset.xml are
           used by ssys.xml
        *) then make sure all the techs in tech.xml are used by asset.xml
        *) then make sure all the outfit/ships are used by both tech.xml
           _AND_ the Lua addOutfit/addShip

MINOR:
 *) Check if planets images are :
    - used and too used (eg. >10)
    - not used
    > Idea: can list planet names by 'space' category filenames
