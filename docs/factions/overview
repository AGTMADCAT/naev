   Faction overview.


   EMPIRE

      The Empire consists of the hard nuclei (Emperor) and assosciated Houses.
   The Houses can only be created by the Emperor's whim and are allowed to
   participate in the Galaxy politics.

      GREAT HOUSES

         There are five Great Houses, a sixth is rumoured to have existed.
      They partake in an important role in Empire politics.

         SIRIUS

            Religious Nuts.


         PROTERON

            Close allies of Sirius.


         SOROMID

            Emperor's right hand.


         DVAERED

            Brutal and more primitive, very warlike.


         ZA'LEK

            Technophiles of the Empire, distrusted by most.



      MINOR HOUSES

         These Houses are given the privileges to participate in the Council,
      but do not have the powers the other Houses have nor the influence.

         GODDARD

            Design and take care of the Goddard ships.



   FRONTIER LIBERATION FRONT

      The Early Tribes that were shunned in the Empire creation and have since
   then forged the Frontier Liberation Front (FLF) into a guerrilla resistance
   movement to resist the advances by the Empire.  They employ dirty tactics
   to level the playing field against the superior Empire.



   SPACE TRADERS

      Independent guild of merchants, protected by the Emperor himself.  They
   keep the galaxy working with their deliveries.



   GALACTIC PIRATES

      Space brought an entire new dimension to pirating.  These outlaws attack
   any ship transporting anything of value with no regard nor respect to
   authority.
