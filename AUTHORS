Contributions
---------------------------------------


	Vega Strike <http://vegastrike.sf.net>
		* Ship Models
		* Music
		* Sounds
		* Planet images
    Wouldn't have been possible without the Vega Strike team, although they
   didn't actively participate, by allowing me to use their data they did me
   a great favour and let me concentrate on the coding.


	Joel Hans <wolorf@gmail.com>
		* Planet Graphics
		* Render Script
    Helped out when the project was starting.  Great morale booster.
	

	Amir Taaki <genjix@gmail.com>
	Rob Loach <http://robloach.net>
		* SDL_collide
    Although we don't use the SDL_collide library itself, it was inspirational
   for NAEV's own collision routines.
	

	Pete Shinners <pete@shinners.org>
		* SavePNG
    Great function ripped straight out of pygame.  Works marvelously!
	
	
	Aurore D. "Rore" <aurore.d@gmail.com>
		* Planet gimp script
    Saved a lot of trouble by allowing us to quickly create space planet
   graphics.


   Andrew Mustun
      * Sprite gimp script
    Although not used directly, it helped create our own sprite script.


   J.C. Wilk
      * Turbulence noise
    After the horrible failure of our own plasma fractal attempt, TCOD's
   turbulence noise seemed to do everything perfectly where we screwed up.
   With heavy optimization the code was introduced to NAEV.
