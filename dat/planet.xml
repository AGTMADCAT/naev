   <description>The surface of the planet is predominantly covered with water and the planetary climate is characterised by abundant precipitation and strong winds, yet tolerable enough to make special and expensive weather control measures unnecessary. Habitable land is often characterised by soft meadows, swamps and dense forests. The resource base of Caladan consists mainly of agriculture and biomass, with the locally bred and grown pundi rice being its main export, and fishing a traditional source of sustenance for its people. Other traditional products include wine and various livestock, most prominently cattle. Cuisine on Caladan is rather refined, with most dishes containing meat.</description>

   <bar>The Jorlan people don't really have a habit for drinking.  You only seem to see other spacefarers in the bar, but no natives.</bar>
   <description>Jorlan is a small moon that orbits Haleb IV.  It's inhabitants are mostly part of the ore refining process, as it supplies most of the Frontier with all sorts of alloys.  Gas miners are also sent down to Haleb IV every dozen STU when the planetary conditions are favorable, otherwise the incredible winds can crush many ships like tin cans.</description>

   <description>Selphod is a very harsh and barren ice planet.  Most of the locals have never ventured outside the established bases.  The reason is that to be able to venture outside you have to wear really heavy thermal protection with a personal generator to keep the body temperature at optimal.  Even then, if the gear isn't worn properly the cold will quickly enter and kill the living being in less then a mTSU.</description>

   <bar>The Raglan bar is a pretty small bar for Dvaered standards, and quite empty too.</bar>
   <description>Raglan Outpost was established after the Dvaered-Frontier war broke out before the Incident.  To this day the Frontier still is demanding for it's dismantling in the halls of the Emperor, although he has yet to make a statement.  Meanwhile the Dvaereds use this base intensively in their fight against the FLF.</description>

   <description>Named after the guardian dog of hell for it's role in monitoring and observing the immense Sol nebulae.  It was created shortly after the nebulae stabilized.  Exact details are confidential and there's more then enough military influence to make it suspicious.  With all the conspiration theories around the Incident, one can never be too sure where reality ends and fiction starts.</description>

   <bar>The Tau Prime algae has a very strong stench which seems to envelope the bar completely.  The smell is soo strong you can actually taste it.  It doesn't taste nearly as good unprocessed. Most algae runners stop to grab drinks between runs to try to get the taste of the algae out of their mouth, although the usually use licor made out of processed algae to do that.</bar>
   <description>Tau Station was constructed with the sole purpose of exploiting the algae produced on Tau Prime.  Being a completely watery algae world with a very corrosive environment, it was deemed more profitable to build a space station then a city on the planet surface.   From the station windows you can see heavy algae collectors flying to and from the surface on their endless algae runs.</description>

   <bar>The drinks served in the Furnance, as the bar calls itself are of a pretty strange variety.  They are generally very strong and served at a warm temperature.  The house specialties also contain volcanic ash which is harvested on the planet surface.  A strange bar indeed.</bar>
   <description>Doranthex Prime is a mostly molten planet.  The only exception is a small island that drifts around the surface mainly around the polar regions.  On this island the Dvaered have established a small base, mainly for research and military prototyping, although civilians are allowed in the main facilities.  Due to the intense temperatures they are shielded by over 50 m of temperature isolating plating, which doesn't allow any views of the planet itself once you've landed.</description>

   <description>Torloth is a heavy mining planet.  It has rich ores and minerals in abundance with no local life forms to speak of.  It's one of the strongholds of the Nexus corporation housing some of their important ship factories.  Of course the bigger ships have to get built off planet.</description>

It's not the usual finer dust you find on most worlds either, it's a thick, consistant, black, disgusting dust that you think you'll never be able to get off you.</bar>
   <description>Jorcan is a very barren dull planet, like most mining worlds.  It's very poor in deposits, but mining is still done heavily in an attempt to remove every single drop of ore from the planet.</description>

   <bar>The Goddard Bar is unsurprisingly an old obsolete model remade as a bar.  It's surprisingly comfortable and  cozy as a bar, although every so often you can hear creaking in the ancient metal frame.</bar>
   <description>Zhiru was a quiet planet, home of House Goddard, one of the minor Houses.  One day House Goddard began a plan to create a massive spacecraft, based on their air-born planes.  The result was the massive Goddard, named after the house that created it.  The ship was a massive success and went about to give House Goddard fame throughout the galaxy.  Now Zhiru is a booming ship factory, specialized in the creation and maintenance of the Goddard ships.  This is all possible due to the weak gravity and atmosphere that envelopes Zhiru that allows the massive spacecraft to land and take off without much difficulty.</description>

   <bar>The Slop and Grill is one of the nastiest taverns in the universe.  The food and drink doesn't exactly help.  Most of it is brewed on New Haven and wouldn't pass any of the minimal health insurance tests.  Some of the booze even doubles as ship fuel if needed, which says a lot about the quality.The clients are also deep space thugs, pirates, contrabandiers, mercenaries and othe shady folk that insist on keeping the ground coated with blood and broken teeth.  Not a great place to bring the family.</bar>
   <description>New Haven is a small planet located beyond the boundries of law and justice.  Founded by Bartax the Great, one of the most successful pirates to ever live after the old Haven was annihilated.The planet is mostly covered by very toxic gases and has a lot of radiation if you stray from the stronghold.  These very features are what made the Empire qualify it as uninhabitable as it doesn't have any strategic resources.  It's distance from other civilized worlds also gives it a nice cover from prying eyes.</description>

   <description>Anecu is a completely aquatic planet.  It's surface is covered completely by water.  In the shallow areas great underwater cities are constructed, as the climate above the water can be very harsh (waves been recorded to be up to 2 km high).  The planet boasts of extensive ship designing facilities, using the high pressure water as a testbed for ships of all sorts.</description>
