<description>
The star product of Aerosys, the Hyena quickly has become a favorite of pirates far and wide.  Not much of a fighter, nor does it pack too much of a punch, but they like to come in swarms to overcome their enemies.  While the Aerosys' official stance is that it doesn't sell them to shady characters, it's widely known that they do as it seems there's a countless amount in the hands of pirates.
