   Humans had always looked up at the skies at night, dreaming of being one with the stars.  Yet they could never imagine what their dreams got them in.

   They ended getting into space and the revolution that this provoked.  With the advent of terraforming technologies colonists began flocking to the stars en masse.  Many worlds were colonnized and humanity expanded.  It was still slow travelling and time was starting to erode humanity's unity.

   Then came the great advance in travel.  Light speeds were finally broken.  This technology spread quickly and reignited the colonization spree.  Humans had conquered a great part of the galaxy.  Things were hectic though, with mankind fragmanted in many factions.  A federation was created to attempt to affront this.

   Yet this only incremented tension.  Man was too fractured to be weaved together with diplomacy.  War broke out, timidly at first, but quickly gathering momentum.  Thus began the Great Faction War.

   Being the first space-era all out global war, the Faction War brought much pain and misery to humanity.  Many planets were annihilated, trillions killed, all in the name each faction.  Mankind started becoming tribal and isolated, seperated by vast space filled with the debris of battleships and smoldering planets.  Then came hope at the hand of Emperor Daedris.

   A newly forged Empire began sweeping the factions, dominating with clear military superiority.  Some factions resisted at first, but most saw the only way was to submit to the iron fist of the Emperor.  Eventually there was only the Empire.  Those who helped in the birth of this Empire were given the status of Great House, and the golden age began.

   Trade routes were created, patrols were installed and piracy was non-existant.  Supplies were being moved all around the Empire and population was booming.  Technology advanced quickly and permitted the terraforming of many new planets.  All was working well.

   Eventually corruption started to appear, slowly at first, but ended up avalanching.  The Great Houses started bickering between each other.  Privateers and Pirates started appearing, while the Emperor started to get drowned in burocracy.  Terrorism also began to appear by sectors of the Empire not content with their status.

   Then suddenly, silence.  No one knows exactly what happened, but a gigantic explosion shook the foundations of the universe.  The magnitude of the explosion was soo enormous that it quickly annihilated many planets leaving a gigantic void in the center of the Empire.  Humanity's birthplace was near the epicenter, and the entire area was covered in a gigantic nebulae.  It is referred to as The Incident and marks the end of the golden age.

   You find yourself in a universe with a decaying Empire, full of piracy and corruption shaken to it's very bones by the Incident.  However where there is chaos, there is also oportunnity.
