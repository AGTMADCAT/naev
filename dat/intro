At night, human beings raise their eyes to heaven. They look up with a question, or in fear, or sometimes with an ambition to venture forth among the stars.

From Earth, the first space-farers discovered tiny jewels shining with the light of distant suns, far away but so clear. To reach out and grasp one would only cost a lifetime. Cheap at the price.

So men and women locked their bodies into hulking metal boxes. They reached out for a fertile sapphire, hurled themselves out into the void. On their arrival, they decanted their decrepit, sleeping forms and found new stars staring coldly down from stranger skies.

From there civilisation spread, as it always has, with exponential enthusiasm -- ripples in the water. Two worlds seeded many. Discoveries followed in a cascade so that news of new planets, exotic geology, and alien flora echoed between the colonies.

However, the new age of discovery lasted only as long as curiosity outpaced greed. Too soon, conflict erupted between settlers on the colonies. Land, fuel, food, and distrust sowed the seeds of discord. Once begun, it spread from world to world in a terrific conflagration.

From the ashes left by a hundred years of interstellar war, a new order eventually built its foundations.

A man named Daedris asserted dominion over the exhausted worlds. He founded a cosmic Empire and named himself its ruler. Under the iron fist of the newly established galactic military, relations between planets resumed, abandoned trade routes saw traffic for the first time in living memory.

Scholars call it the zenith: technology leapt forward, culture flourished, irradiated rock was cleansed and dead planets brought back to life. Peace reigned in an imperial golden age.

After Daedris, his successors oversaw a slow collapse. The Empire fractured into religious factions and squabbling classes. The great projects of the imperium went awry -- administration fell into the hands of great powers, the houses, whose militaries now controlled the space lanes. Rise and fall, the rhythm of history. 

But the Incident broke history. It tore the heart out of the Empire.

From Earth, a cataclysmic explosion ripped through space, annihilating stars, vaporising worlds. Dozens of systems disappeared into a mysterious nebula. Now only a shattered remnant of civilisation survives. 

What else remains? Questions.

Ten SCU have passed. You take command of your ship in a universe ruled by the shard of a decaying Empire. After the Incident, corruption and piracy run rampant. But where there is chaos, there is also opportunity.

Welcome to the universe of Naevâ€¦
