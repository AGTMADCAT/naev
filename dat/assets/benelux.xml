  <description>Benelux is a poor planet, and the Za'lek mostly mine here for valuable gasses and minerals. Weapons testing also happens here, so most of the population is either scientists or laborers. There is little else of interest here.</description>
  <bar>The bar is aplain prefab unit with grimy laborers and only moderately cleaner scientists talking amongst themsevles. You are served an odd-looking drink that tastes fruity. There seems to be little else to do.</bar>
