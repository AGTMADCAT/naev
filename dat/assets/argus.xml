  <description>Argus is a trade hub between the various system of the Za'lek, as well as a stopping point for any number of scientists or military on their way to Ruadan. The station is known to have ties with Hubble's crowd, so outsiders are not regarded warmly here.</description>
  <bar>You are only grudgingly served in this bar, and all the patrons glare at you for intruding. Some Za'lek look sympathetic, but they are shunned as much as you are.</bar>
