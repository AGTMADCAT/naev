  <description>Dr. Cassini makes his headquarters here, along with his staff. It is a generally quiet sation, and the people are polite and courteous. However, there is an edge of uneasiness, as the Naval Academy is not too far away, and the differances between the two branches of the Za'lek academic community has been widening of late. It is enough to set everyone on edge.</description>
  <bar>A picture of Dr. Cassini hangs over the mantle of the bar, and several philosophers and scientists are makiing small talk and gonig over business. It is a relaxing place, and soft music plays in the background.</bar>
