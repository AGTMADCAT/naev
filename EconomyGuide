long-term and short term plans, not definite

System:

	Each system has a stockpile of goods, and a stockpile of credits

	Each system produces some goods and consumes others

	Each system is the cumulation of it's assets. So a system containing
		a farming world and manufacturing station will produce both things


	The price of a good in a system is credit_stockpile/good_stockpile, where
		the stockpiles are amount of goods on hand

	A system that is low on a good will produce more/consume less of it, while
		highly stocked systems will produce less/consume more of it


Trade:

	Every dt, systems will trade with their neighbors

	Trading systems will agree on an average of their prices, and sell/buy
		goods, with no losses of credits or goods

	Galaxial trade is limited to a certain amount, trade_max. Trade between
		two systems is limited to 
		possible_trade_amount *(trademax/total_possible_galaxial_trade)
			-may change





Goods:

	Standard traded goods
	
	Present in every system, even if not viewable/seeable as such

Notes:

Trade:
	Might change. Current system works like electric current, but traders should generally
		choose most profitable paths, regardless how "Full" it may be

	"Trader" systems (empty systems) will always gain profits. Some counterbalance to that
		is needed. 




Goods:

	POSSIBLE:

	--

	Apply gaussian distribution to consumption/production. For the lulz

	Pirate/Trader expenditures
		-"Trader" systems (empty systems) will always gain profits. 
			This is to balance that out:
			-Trader systems consume these, but consumption goes to 0
			-Bordering or trade hub systems will produce these, production ->0 


	

	Taxes
		Produced by aristocratic/military systems and consumed by production/working
			class systems



What to do if a system goes bankrupt?

Currently, "trade current" is price difference / resistance. This is generally fine, but
	it causes neighbors with massive price differences to over-sell / buy

	Maybe this is fine?
