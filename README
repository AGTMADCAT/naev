    X.) COMPILING

      NAEV's build system is rather simple - Install the dependencies
      and then run make, and you're done.

      However, many Linux distributions package antiquated versions of
      libvorbis that are incompatible with NAEV.

      To resolve this, static-linking patches for the Makefile are
      available, as well as static versions of the libvorbis libaries.

      If you need to compile statically, please download and extract
      http://deiz2.ath.cx/naev/libvorbis.tar.gz into NAEV's directory.
         Example: wget http://deiz2.ath.cx/naev/libvorbis.tar.gz
         tar -xf libvorbis.tar.gz

      The included static libraries are libvorbis 1.2.3, sourced from
      Gentoo, but should work on all systems.

         Assuming a 32-bit system, starting in the base dir:
            patch -p1 < libvorbis/libvorbis-32.patch

         If you wish to change the default ndata path, you can uncomment
         the NDATA_DEF line in the Makefile and set it as applicable.
            Example: NDATA_DEF := \"/usr/share/games/naev/ndata\"

         Compilation can now proceed, simply type make and the compilation
         should finish without issue.
            One libxml warning is common. The cause has been fixed and it
            will be incorporated in new libxml releases.

         This will produce two files, naev and ndata. The naev binary will
         search for ndata in the working and the binary directories.

      Note: While only one audio backend needs to be compiled in, it's wise
      to compile with both enabled to provide a fallback.

    X.) INSTALLATION

      NAEV currently does not support 'make install', and will do nothing
      beyond building the binary and ndata.

      If you wish to create a .desktop for your desktop environment, logos
      from 16x16 to 128x128 can be found in extras/logos

      A manpage is also included. As a game, NAEV's manpage is a man(6) and
      usually belongs in /usr/share/man/man6, though this may vary.

    X.) CRASHES

      If NAEV is crashing during gameplay, please file a bug report after
      reading http://code.google.com/p/naev/wiki/Debugging.
      If NAEV crashes on launch with an error such as 'undefined symbol:
      ov_read_filter', your version of libvorbis is outdated, please see
      the appropriate FAQ entry: http://code.google.com/p/naev/wiki/FAQ

    X.) KEYBINDINGS

      X.0) Introduction
         X.0.0) About
            NAEV uses a dynamic keybinding system that allows you to set 
            the keybindings to joystick, keyboard or a mixture of both.

            This can changed via ~/.naev/conf.lua, or with the in-game editor.

         X.0.1) Joystick
            If you have a joystick you'll have to tell NAEV which joystick
            to use.  You can either use the -j or -J parameter from the
            command-line or put it in the conf.lua file.
            Examples:
               naev -j 0
               naev -J "Precision"
               joystick = "Precision" # in conf.lua
         X.0.2) Syntax
            KEY_IDENTIFIER = { type = KEY_TYPE, key = KEY_NUMBER,
                  [reverse = KEY_REVERSE, mod = MOD_IDENTIFIER] }
            KEY_IDENTIFIER is the identifier given below
            KEY_TYPE can be one of keyboard, jaxis or jbutton
            KEY_NUMBER is the number of the key (found with xev usually, just
               convert the keysym from hex to base 10)
            KEY_REVERSE is whether it is reversed or not, which is only useful
               in the case of jaxis
            MOD_IDENTIFIER is the modifier to take into account, can be one of:
               lctrl, rctrl, lshift, rshift, lmeta, rmeta, ralt, lalt
               It isn't used with joystick bindings.
         X.0.3) Example
            accel = { type = "jbutton", key = 0 }
            see conf.example for more examples
