 X.) COMPILING

   Run: 

   ./autogen.sh && ./configure
   make

   If you need special settings you should pass flags to configure, using -h
   will tell you what it supports.


 X.) INSTALLATION

   NAEV currently supports make install which will install everything that
   is needed.

   If you wish to create a .desktop for your desktop environment, logos
   from 16x16 to 128x128 can be found in extras/logos

 X.) CRASHES

   If NAEV is crashing during gameplay, please file a bug report after
   reading http://code.google.com/p/naev/wiki/Debugging.
   If NAEV crashes on launch with an error such as 'undefined symbol:
   ov_read_filter', your version of libvorbis is outdated, please see
   the appropriate FAQ entry: http://code.google.com/p/naev/wiki/FAQ

 X.) KEYBINDINGS

   You can now changhe keybindings in game which may be more comfortable for
   you then editting the configuration file.

   X.0) Introduction
      X.0.0) About
         NAEV uses a dynamic keybinding system that allows you to set 
         the keybindings to joystick, keyboard or a mixture of both.

         This can changed via ~/.naev/conf.lua, or with the in-game editor.

      X.0.1) Joystick
         If you have a joystick you'll have to tell NAEV which joystick
         to use.  You can either use the -j or -J parameter from the
         command-line or put it in the conf.lua file.
         Examples:
            naev -j 0
            naev -J "Precision"
            joystick = "Precision" # in conf.lua
      X.0.2) Syntax
         KEY_IDENTIFIER = { type = KEY_TYPE, key = KEY_NUMBER,
               [reverse = KEY_REVERSE, mod = MOD_IDENTIFIER] }
         KEY_IDENTIFIER is the identifier given below
         KEY_TYPE can be one of keyboard, jaxis or jbutton
         KEY_NUMBER is the number of the key (found with xev usually, just
            convert the keysym from hex to base 10)
         KEY_REVERSE is whether it is reversed or not, which is only useful
            in the case of jaxis
         MOD_IDENTIFIER is the modifier to take into account, can be one of:
            lctrl, rctrl, lshift, rshift, lmeta, rmeta, ralt, lalt
            It isn't used with joystick bindings.
      X.0.3) Example
         accel = { type = "jbutton", key = 0 }
         see conf.example for more examples
